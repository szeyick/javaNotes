<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>
In this section, you'll find a basic introduction to the type system that exists in Java and how it forms the basic structure of any application.
</p>
<p>
Java uses the concept of <b>Objects</b>, which when compared to something in the real-world is essentailly a "thing" (i.e Dog, Car, Plane). Each one of these objects is an instance of (has a <b> is-a </b> relationship) of a <b>type</b>.
</p>
<p>>
A <b>type</b> defines what sort of object that it is. Again using the real world example, a type can consist of such things like, Animal or Vehicle. It is there to ensure that our object complies to the Object <b>is-a</b> Type (Animal, Vehicle) relationship.
